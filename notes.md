## Todo 	
- API
- Documentation
- Tests - show example how to write test for routes
- Business logic
- Migrations
- Basic role system
- swag docs can't set query params with string\[string]=string

## Resolved
- routes: create, login
- middleware: jwt
- business logic
    - authorization
    - model of user, workout, workout_type, workout_value
    - password checking
- sqlx: extension of database/sql for better life
- basic query builder (find, orderBy, offsetRows, andWhere, maxResult method in repository) (deprecated)
- in FindBy - set flexible field selection (deprecated)
- parser query parameters (deprecated)
#Business logic
### basic CRUD
 - user
 - workout
 - workout type
 - workout value
## Workout scheme
##### workout type - `(run, gym)` and
##### workout template - `(workout scheme of certain units for workout type)`
have a finite set of values that can be stored in the cache (redis).
##### workout_template - `will store in map and maybe will move in db or cache`

#API

# In progress
 - JWT
   - create secret key in env
 - Logging
   - use echo
 - describe a thing like DTO in symfony (to hide private fields as password)
 - describe methods for basic api functional 
     - getById, update, sort, filter, per page (offset),        
     - get all
